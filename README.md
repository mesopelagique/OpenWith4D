# OpenWith4D

Utility scripts to open with 4D for macOS from Terminal and other apps.

## Why?

The current version of 4D do not allow to open the project folder or a source file not in current opened project.

This script will find associated project file to open it.

## Install on macOS

Download using terminal

```bash
sudo curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mesopelagique/OpenWith4D/master/macos/4d -o /usr/local/bin/4d && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/4d
```

> ðŸ’¡ Your password will be prompted to install in `/usr/local/bin`
